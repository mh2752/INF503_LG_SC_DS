	--------------------------------- HW4: Subproblem 1B -----------------------------------

		Out of 1K Random Sequences, 0 Were Found in the SARS-COV2 Genome Using Smith-Waterman.

		Time (in seconds) to test against 1K random sequences = 72

		Out of 10K Random Sequences, 0 Were Found in the SARS-COV2 Genome Using Smith-Waterman.

		Time to test against 10K random sequences = 712

		Out of 100K Random Sequences, 0 Were Found in the SARS-COV2 Genome Using Smith-Waterman.

		Time to test against 100K random sequences = 6906

		Out of 1Million Random Sequences, 0 Were Found in the SARS-COV2 Genome Using Smith-Waterman.

		Time to Test Against 1Million Random Sequences = 75000
